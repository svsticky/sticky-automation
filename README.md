# Sticky automation
This repository contains a collection of script that are used by Study Association Sticky. The repository is split up in two sections; Google Scripts and Exact.

The first platform is Exact Online. Part of this is injecting Javascript (Tampermonkey) in to Exact Online (due to a lack of API's or Settings).

The second platform is Google Apps. As the usage of libraries is not recommended by Google, a composer has been built that adds the libraries to scripts. A wide variety of scripts have been made that are tailor-made to Sticky's customs and existing documents.

Both folders also contain README's with how to use and work with the given scripts.
